# Binary and AVL_trees
binary_tree.py contains an implementaiton of a binary tree, at the bottom of the file are some functions that need implementing to turn the binary tree into an AVL_tree

testing.py is what I've been using to run the code and it displays the trees.

I've based the binary tree implementation on this one: https://github.com/laurentluce/python-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/binary_tree.py

I've extended it to AVL trees using: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/ 

Instructions:
  1)Add parents to the class
  
  2)Extend insert and delete to add/remove parents

  3)Implement rotate_right and rotate_left
